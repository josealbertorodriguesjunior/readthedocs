Contributing
======================================================

There are many ways to contribute to Subutai Crowd Cloud, many ways to join
the Horde [#]_ !

Start Using Subutai
-------------------

In minutes, peers can be fired up using `Subutai Vagrant Boxes <https://subutai.io/install/index.html>`_. 
Once up, register them with the Hub, and start installing applications
from the Subutai Bazaar. There are several open source applications to choose
from. You can instantly host them on your own peer and access them from 
anywhere. This alone feels empowering.

If you need more computing power or want to earn more GoodWill start sharing 
and renting resources to others. Tell your friends and have them share resources
with you. You can run applications across each others peers and even make them
redundant and fault tolerant.


What do you think?
------------------

Give us feedback! We want to know how we can improve the user experience for
everyone. Your feedback is extremely valueable to us. Plus we want to light up
that globe. We peers all around the world the power of the P2P community 
increases and the Subutai Horde grows.


Design the P2P cloud economy
----------------------------

This is always a work in progress. We're trying to build an economy around
GoodWill, a digital asset generated by good deeds, and by providing resources
to others. It's consumed by negative actions that threaten the collective
experience or by consuming from others which is not necessarily negative, but
a natural consequence.

We're trying to model something intangible in a concrete way when it comes
to collaborative consumption in the cloud crowd. Eventually GoodWill itself
will be exchanged for cryptocurrencies as a Smart Token. We want to make sure
we get this right, and keep improving it going forward. That happens with the
community, not in a vacuum.

The design of the economy is something we're adamant about making community
driven. We've started with the basic service level agreements, however we know
people will find all kinds of exceptions and scenarios we never thought of
before. This is a new world, and we're excited by what we're going to find. We
want to do this together in the Horde.


Everything blow is a work in progress.


Earn GoodWill and Prosper
-------------------------

There are many ways to earn GoodWill in the P2P cloud economy. List them.

Create new application blueprints
---------------------------------

One click cloud application installation is critical. We want people from all
walks of life to be able to launch an application in their own cloud, with the
same ease in which they install an iPhone application from the AppStore. We 
believe that bridging this gap between non-technical users and open source
products is crutial for the success of open source in the cloud era. Subutai
Blueprints were designed to make open source cloud applications easy to install
and use for mass consumption.

The more open source applications available to users at the press of a button,
the more choices, and the greater the productivity experienced by the crowd
cloud. More applications just increases the things we can do together. 



Contribute resources to OS GithHub Projects
-------------------------------------------


Get Free Resources for GitHub Projects
--------------------------------------

We need projects on GitHub to register for the OS contribution program and provide blueprints for applications to be made available to all users in the Subutai Bazaar.
Next we need developers! We need Ethereum blockchain and Solidity savvy engineers, P2P researchers to help us experiment and optimize DHT and Gossip protocols. We need C/C++, Java, Javascript, Golang programmers. If you want to get involved as a developer first give Subutai a try as a user. Then take a look at our list of GitHub projects below. Come onto our Slack channel and let us know if you need help diving in.  We’re here and waiting for you!
Register on the Subutai Hub this month using the Linux Journal code LJOCT17, and we’ll give you some goodwill to trade cloud resources with others on the system. Happy sharing!

.. [#] In a single word, Horde, describes the Subutai Cloud Crowd. Subutai allows crowds to collectively and dynamically pool resources to conquer computing challenges they never could alone on their own.
