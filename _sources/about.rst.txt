About
======================================================


The Open Source Project and its community formed in 2013 to build a peer-to-peer 
(P2P) container based cloud and fog [#]_ computing platform called Subutai. The
Subutai Software was first released in April of 2014 under the Apache Software
License 2.0.

Subutai runs cloud applications inside adaptive virtual environments spanning across idle
computer resources [#]_ securely over the Internet. Anyone can consume resources from
others, while also providing resources to others [#]_. Resources may be shared for free
or rented hourly at a price determined by their owners or based on market values.
Those buying and selling resources determine the market prices of resources used to
run cloud applications on the edge, and in the data center.

The Subutai Ecosystem uses a digital asset called GoodWill backed by cryptocurrencies
to enable its P2P token based sharing economy without centralized actors. GoodWill
drives the Subutai Token Economy and ensures fair play.

The Subutai Router, an optional hardware component, is a "Green" cryptocurrency mining
router and tangible hardware wallet. The Subutai Router, is Open Hardware running the
Open Source Subutai Firmware directly onboard. The Subutai Router uses the latest 
Xilinx UltraScale FPGA SoC to hardware accelerate line rate security features, 
advanced cloud router functions, and IoT gateway capabilities. The router has Arduino, 
Raspberry Pi, and PMOD headers to augment it's functions and applications.

The Subutai Software is in it's 6th major release and ready for production use. The first
version of the Subutai Router was manufactured in 2016. The second major version of the
Subutai Router is being prepared for mass production in Q2 of 2018 in conjunction with
the University of Sao Paulo.

The Subutai Software and the Subutai Router Hardware are both 100% free and open, both 
licensed under the business friendly Apache Software License v2.0.

.. [#] The term, fog computing, coined by Cisco, refers to computing on the edge of the Internet where all the devices, the Internet of Things reside. The term plays on cloud computing and the meteorological definition of fog as low altitude clouds making contact with land. The edge of the Internet (as opposed to the center where high bandwidth lines and data centers are located) is the land in the analogy. The clouds in the sky resides in data centers and the fog on the edge.
.. [#] According to several studies, 98% of personal computer resources run idle. Another study showed 94% of EC2 instance resources in AWS (the cloud) run idle while 96% on self hosted servers run idle in company data centers. When you add all this up globally, itâ€™s reasonable to conclude that a massive amount of computer resources needlessly perish every day.
.. [#] The ability to consume and provide at the same time is often referred to as collaborative consumption. A community where collaborative consumption takes place is called a sharing economy, or peer economy since all participants are similar in that they can all buy and sell.
